# Work around for Vue having a lack of a configurable publicPath that isn't relative (relative breaks history routing).
# Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an easier way of doing this without rebuilding.
# Since we have a single web image, doesn't make sense to build the web-artifacts twice. 
# Perhaps webpack 5 will have some sort of fix for this.
