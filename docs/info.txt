This includes more information regarding the Supreme Court Viewer. 

The Supreme Court Viewer leverages the JC-Interface for all of it's calls. 
The source code for the JC-Interface is private. 

It runs two different web pods for Production only (as there is no TEST or DEV SiteMinder environment):
    Siteminder
    Non-Siteminder

The Supreme Court Viewer has two routes into the application:
1. Internally with Siteminder through jag. Target users are judges. 
2. Externally without Siteminder through justice. Target users are counsel (from Access to Audio).

Three ways to get access to the application:
1. Siteminder for the Supreme Judiciary - calling UserInfo in CEIS.
2. Keycloak for Counsel using Verifiable Credentials: Access to Audio backend call allowing access to specific Civil Files.
3. Keycloak for Admins using IDIR: Group access via IDIR (either Provincial or Supreme).
